# stocks-analysis
##Overview of Project: 
This project involves analyzing different stocks for the year 2017 and 2018 and refactor the code to make it more efficient.

###Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose was to analyze and compare the original code and then refactored one to see if the code will make VBA script run smoothly and efficiently. There were 12 tickers to look at each ticker and see the total volume and return for the years 2017 and 2018.

##Results: 
The year 2017 showed that it had positive return on ticker and safe for investment. The year 2018 didnâ€™t show as high return and total volumes was also down. One reason could be higher prices in year 2018 as comparatively to 2017.

##Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

##Summary: 
###What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages of refactoring the code are many such as it improves the design of the software and easier to understand and read the code by simplifying it. It makes the code run smoothly and efficiently.
Another advantage is that you can improve the performance of the code by simply fixing the bugs in the code. 
Disadvantages:
One disadvantage is the time, because it requires more time to figure out without adding new elements in the software system.
It is more cost effective , and it can be risky and complex to run the code.

###How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The run time has dropped in the refactored VBA script as compared to original one. Refactored code is much faster. Refactored code had much faster run time because of the changes made to the original code.
The pros for refactoring the original VBA script would be making the code easier to read and improving the performance.
The cons for refactoring the original VBA script would be time consuming and most costly.
